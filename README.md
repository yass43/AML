# Advanced Machine Learning Class Repository

This repository contains the slides and related materials for the talks we presented in the Advanced Machine Learning class which is designed as a journal-club where students present and discuss ML papers. 

## Talks

### Talk 1: Score-Based Generative Modeling through Stochastic Differential Equations

- Paper Title: Score-Based Generative Modeling through Stochastic Differential Equations
- Authors: Yang Song, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Diederik P. Kingma, Abhishek Kumar, Stefano Ermon, Ben Poole

#### Abstract
The paper introduces diffusion models under the SDE framework and thus allows a better understanding of them relying on the SDE theory and Ito's calculus.  
They make the following contributions :  
* Unified framework of several diffusion methods
* Controllable generation of the samples
* Flexible sampling and likelihood computation
